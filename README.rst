Create multi-sample text-pileups of streaming SAM/BAM files.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://streaming-pileupy.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

Streaming Pileupy creates a pileup of a single SAM/BAM file
using the read group SM identifier to split reads by sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    # extract sample names from read group SM tag
    samtools view -H input.bam \
      | grep '^@RG' \
      | perl -pne 's/.*SM:(\S+).*/$1/' \
      | sort | uniq > sample_names.txt

    # create read-group aware pileup
    spileup input.bam sample_names.txt

Base quality filtering
``````````````````````

Bases with less than a certain quality can be filtered with ``-Q``.


Missing features
----------------

* Read beginning and end annotations in pileup output
* Deletion annotations in pileup output
* Filter output bases on BED file
